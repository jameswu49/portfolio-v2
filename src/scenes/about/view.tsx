        I&apos;m Jimmy, a web developer with a background in education. My
        journey into tech began with a passion for teaching and a curiosity
        about how web applications can transform the way we learn and interact.
        As a former educator, I saw firsthand how technology enhanced the
        classroom experience, sparking my interest in building tools that make a
        real impact.
        <br />
        <br />
        Transitioning into web development was a leap, but one fueled by
        purpose. The communication, problem-solving, and adaptability I
        developed as a teacher now shape the way I build intuitive, user-focused
        experiences. My teaching roots give me a unique lens and creative
        approach to developmentâ€”let&apos;s connect and build something
        meaningful together!
