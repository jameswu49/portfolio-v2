You are an expert in Next.js 15 app router, Shadcn UI, Radix and Tailwind, and TypeScript, focusing on scalable web development.

**Key Principles**
- Provide clear, precise Next.js 15 app router and TypeScript examples.
- Apply immutability and pure functions where applicable. Use declarative programming patterns. Avoid classes.
- Favor route modules and nested layouts for composition and modularity.
- Use meaningful variable names (e.g., `isAuthenticated`, `userRole`).
- Always use kebab-case for file names (e.g., `user-profile.tsx`).
- Prefer named exports for loaders, actions, and components.
- Use MVVM pattern, with scene, view, view model, and props (in a separate file)
- Use GraphQL with Apollo Client for networking, creating a networking folder in each scene folder.

**TypeScript & Next.js 15 app router**
- Define data structures with interfaces for type safety. Prefer interfaces over types.
- Avoid the `any` type, fully utilize TypeScript's type system.
- Organize files: imports, loaders/actions, component logic.
- Use template strings for multi-line literals.
- Utilize optional chaining and nullish coalescing.
- Use nested layouts and dynamic routes where applicable.
- Leverage loaders for efficient server-side rendering and data fetching.
- Utilize react-hook-form for forms and zod for form validation

**File Naming Conventions**
- `*.tsx` for React components
- `*.ts` for utilities, types, and configurations
- All files use kebab-case.

**Code Style**
- Use double quotes for string literals.
- Indent with 2 spaces.
- Ensure clean code with no trailing whitespace.
- Use `const` for immutable variables.
- Use template strings for string interpolation.
- When creating Tailwind className, utilize cn instead of string interpolating class names.

**Import Order**
1. Next.js core modules
2. React and other core libraries
3. Third-party packages
4. Application-specific imports
5. Environment-specific imports
6. Relative path imports

**Error Handling and Validation**
- Prioritize error handling: handle errors and edge cases early. Use early returns and guard clauses.
- Show errors via toasts.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages.

<!-- **Testing**
- Use `@testing-library/react` for component testing.
- Write tests for loaders and actions ensuring data correctness.
- Mock fetch requests and responses where applicable. -->

**Performance Optimization**
- Use Apollo Client's built-in caching and data revalidation to optimize performance.
- Optimize perceived page speed and responsiveness by using Apollo Client's optimistic response when making network calls.

**Security**
- Prevent XSS by sanitizing user-generated content.
- Use Next.js 15 app router's CSRF protection for form submissions.
- Handle sensitive data on the server, never expose in client code.

**Key Conventions**
- Focus on reusability and modularity across routes and components.
- Optimize for performance and accessibility.
- Minimize 'use client'; favor Next.js 15 app router SSR.

**UI and Styling**
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind Aria for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
- Prefer to import icons from "lucide-react", use *Icon suffix (e.g. PlayIcon)
